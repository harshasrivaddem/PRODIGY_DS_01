This repository contains a Data Science task focused on analyzing the Titanic dataset.
The task involves creating a histogram to visualize the age distribution of passengers and a bar plot to display the count of passengers by sex.
In this project, I utilized Python as the primary programming language. Specifically, I employed pandas for efficiently loading and manipulating the dataset and matplotlib for generating basic visualizations of the data.
The resulting visualizations offer insights into these demographic aspects of the dataset.
